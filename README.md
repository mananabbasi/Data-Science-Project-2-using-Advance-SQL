# Data-Science-Project-2-using-Advance-SQL
Task Details
As the database consultant, you are required to design the database system based on the 
information provided above, along with a number of associated database objects, such as
stored procedures, user-defined functions, views and triggers. Your submission will take the 
form of working T-SQL statements required for the steps outlined below, a backup of 
database created, and a report explaining and justifying your design decisions, and the 
process you followed to complete the tasks. You should include screenshots and the T-SQL 
statements within the report itself.
Part1:
1. You should design and normalise your proposed database into 3NF, fully explaining and 
justifying your database design decisions and documenting the process you have gone
through to implement this design using T-SQL statements in Microsoft SQL Server 
Management Studio, using screenshots to support your explanation. All tables and
views must be created using T-SQL statements, which should be included in your
report. Clearly highlight which column(s) are primary keys or foreign keys. You should 
also explain the data type used for each column and justify the reason for choosing 
this. You should also consider using constraints when creating your database to help 
ensure data integrity. You must include a database diagram as part of your submission. 
If you have made any additional assumptions aside from the information above when
designing your database, you should clearly state these.
Create tables according to the scenario explained above which should include details on 
patients, doctors, medical records, appointments, and departments. Populate (Insert) 
the tables with the appropriate number of records (at least 7). You should also ensure
the data you input allows you to adequately test that all the following queries.
